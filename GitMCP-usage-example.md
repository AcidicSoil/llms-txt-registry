### gitmcp Server usage

for ANY work or questions relating to <libraries> and/or providers use the <name>_docs server for that repo:

- call search_<name>_documentation to find relevant docs
- call fetch_<name>_documentation to read the primary docs
- reflect on the input question
- call fetch_url_content for any external URLs referenced
- call search_<name>_code if code locations are referenced or needed
- use this to answer the question
