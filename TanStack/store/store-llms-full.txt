TanStack Store is a framework agnostic data store that ships with framework specific adapters for major frameworks like React, Solid, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.

TanStack Store is primarily used for state management internally for most framework agnostic TanStack libraries. It can also be used as a standalone library for any framework or application.

title: Quick Start
id: quick-start
---

TanStack Store is, first and foremost, a framework-agnostic signals implementation.

It can be used with any of our framework adapters, but can also be used in vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript. It's currently used to power many of our library's internals.

## Store

You'll start by creating a new store instance, which is a wrapper around your data:

```typescript
import { Store } from '@tanstack/store';

const countStore = new Store(0);

console.log(countStore.state); // 0
countStore.setState(() => 1);
console.log(countStore.state); // 1
```

This `Store` can then be used to track updates to your data:

```typescript
const unsub = countStore.subscribe(() => {
  console.log('The count is now:', countStore.state);
});

// Later, to cleanup
unsub();
```

You can even transform the data before it's updated:

```typescript
const count = new Store(12, {
  updateFn: (prevValue) => (updateValue) => {
    return updateValue(prevValue) + previous;
  }
});

count.setState(() => 12);
// count.state === 24
```

And implement a primitive form of derived state:

```typescript
let double = 0;
const count = new Store(0, {
  onUpdate: () => {
    double = count.state * 2;
  }
})
```

### Batch Updates

You can batch updates to a store by using the `batch` function:

```typescript
import { batch } from '@tanstack/store';

// countStore.subscribers will only trigger once at the end with the final state
batch(() => {
  countStore.setState(() => 1);
  countStore.setState(() => 2);
});
```

## Derived

You can also use the `Derived` class to create derived values that lazily update when their dependencies change:

```typescript
const count = new Store(0);

const double = new Derived({
  fn: () => count.state * 2,
  // Must explicitly list dependencies
  deps: [count]
});

// Must mount the derived value to start listening for updates
const unmount = double.mount();

// Later, to cleanup
unmount();
```

### Previous Derived Value

You can access the previous value of a derived computation by using the `prevVal` argument passed to the `fn` function:

```typescript
const count = new Store(1);

const double = new Derived({
  fn: ({ prevVal }) => {
    return count.state + (prevVal ?? 0);
  },
  deps: [count]
});

double.mount();
double.state; // 1
count.setState(() => 2);
double.state; // 3
```

### Dependency Values

You can access the values of the dependencies of a derived computation by using the `prevDepVals` and `currDepVals` arguments passed to the `fn` function:

```typescript
const count = new Store(1);

const double = new Derived({
  fn: ({ prevDepVals, currDepVals }) => {
    return (prevDepVals[0] ?? 0) + currDepVals[0];
  },
  deps: [count]
});

double.mount();
double.state; // 1
count.setState(() => 2);
double.state; // 3
```

## Effects

You can also use the `Effect` class to manage side effects across multiple stores and derived values:

```typescript
const effect = new Effect({
  fn: () => {
    console.log('The count is now:', count.state);
  },
  // Array of `Store`s or `Derived`s
  deps: [count],
  // Should effect run immediately, default is false
  eager: true
})

// Must mount the effect to start listening for updates
const unmount = effect.mount();

// Later, to cleanup
unmount();
```

# Simple

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

# Svelte + TS + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Svelte and TypeScript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

## Need an official Svelte framework?

Check out [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit#readme), which is also powered by Vite. Deploy anywhere with its serverless-first approach and adapt to various platforms, with out of the box support for TypeScript, SCSS, and Less, and easily-added support for mdsvex, GraphQL, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, and more.

## Technical considerations

**Why use this over SvelteKit?**

- It brings its own routing solution which might not be preferable for some users.
- It is first and foremost a framework that just happens to use Vite under the hood, not a Vite app.

This template contains as little as possible to get started with Vite + TypeScript + Svelte, while taking into account the developer experience with regards to HMR and intellisense. It demonstrates capabilities on par with the other `create-vite` templates and is a good starting point for beginners dipping their toes into a Vite + Svelte project.

Should you later need the extended capabilities and extensibility provided by SvelteKit, the template has been structured similarly to SvelteKit so that it is easy to migrate.

**Why `global.d.ts` instead of `compilerOptions.types` inside `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json`?**

Setting `compilerOptions.types` shuts out all other types not explicitly listed in the configuration. Using triple-slash references keeps the default TypeScript setting of accepting type information from the entire workspace, while also adding `svelte` and `vite/client` type information.

**Why include `.vscode/extensions.json`?**

Other templates indirectly recommend extensions via the README, but this file allows VS Code to prompt the user to install the recommended extension upon opening the project.

**Why enable `allowJs` in the TS template?**

While `allowJs: false` would indeed prevent the use of `.js` files in the project, it does not prevent the use of JavaScript syntax in `.svelte` files. In addition, it would force `checkJs: false`, bringing the worst of both worlds: not being able to guarantee the entire codebase is TypeScript, and also having worse typechecking for the existing JavaScript. In addition, there are valid use cases in which a mixed codebase may be relevant.

**Why is HMR not preserving my local component state?**

HMR state preservation comes with a number of gotchas! It has been disabled by default in both `svelte-hmr` and `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` due to its often surprising behavior. You can read the details [here](https://github.com/rixo/svelte-hmr#svelte-hmr).

If you have state that's important to retain within a component, consider creating an external store which would not be replaced by HMR.

```ts
// store.ts
// An extremely simple external store
import { writable } from 'svelte/store'
export default writable(0)
```

--- CONTRIBUTING.md ---
# Contributing

- Clone the repo
  - `gh repo clone TanStack/store`
- Ensure `node` is installed
  - https://nodejs.org/en/
- Ensure `pnpm` is installed
  - https://pnpm.io/installation
  - Why? We use `pnpm` to manage workspace dependencies. It's easily the best monorepo/workspace experience available as of when this was written.
- Install dependencies
  - `pnpm install`
  - This installs dependencies for all of the packages in the monorepo, even examples!
  - Dependencies inside of the packages and examples are automatically linked together as local/dynamic dependencies.
- Run the build or dev watcher
  - `pnpm build` or
  - `pnpm dev`
- Navigate to an example
  - `cd examples/react/basic`
- Run the example
  - `pnpm dev`
- Make changes to the code
  - If you ran `pnpm dev` the dev watcher will automatically rebuild the code that has changed
