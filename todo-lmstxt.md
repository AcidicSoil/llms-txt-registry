  Embedding the source URL (and other metadata like the model version, timestamp, etc.)
  directly into the artifact's frontmatter at generation time solves the "reverse lookup"
  problem completely.

  If lmstxt emitted something like this at the top of llms.txt:

   1 ---
   2 source_url: <https://github.com/tanstack/router>
   3 generator: lmstxt v0.1.0
   4 model: qwen-2.5-7b
   5 timestamp: 2023-10-27T10:00:00Z
   6 ---

  Then:

   1. Zero-guesswork imports: My populate script could read the URL directly from the file.
   2. Self-documenting artifacts: Consumers (and AIs!) reading the file know exactly where it
      came from and how stale it might be.
   3. Audit trail: You can verify if a file was generated by an old/buggy version of the
      generator.

  Since we are treating lmstxt as an external tool (installed via pip), we can't easily
  change its code right now within this registry project.

  However, my GeneratorRunner wrapper can inject this!

  When GeneratorRunner runs, it knows the URL. After lmstxt finishes, GeneratorRunner (or
  ArtifactIngest) can prepend this frontmatter to the files before saving them to docs/.

  Decision: I should update src/artifact_ingest/ingest.py to add this frontmatter during the
  normalization phase.
